## RESTy

RESTy is an API Server client application. It's a lot like Postman or httpie, but it runs in the browser.

For this project, you will build a similar application, covering most of the core features (details below).

The style and functionality as presented must be matched. You must use your own markup and CSS.

Treat the deployed application as a mockup/redline.
